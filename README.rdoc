== Think Software
==== A new way to organize your and your team's workflow.

=== How does it works?
Basically you need a simple account, and your brain lighted up.

<b>We think that everyone can be useful</b> and we created a platform where them can <b>share their thinking and works</b>.

People can share their projects, thinking and other stuff, like a simple shopping list and understand:
* who is working over
* who thinked that
* how hard is the work
* if people are in feeling each other 

<b>Each task(work)</b> need to be weighted so who complete them, <b>accumulate points.</b>

Points will be converted in <b>donations</b>, calculated from the base of project's donations. For example:
* Your project receive 100.00 $.
* There are 5 workers and 1 thinker.
* Each worker complete 1 task.
* Each task weights 100 points.
* Each worker gains 20.00 $

=== How to contribute?

I repeat: "we think that everyone can be useful", so you can contribute in many different ways:
[one] You can talk about this project to your friends
[two] You can contribute in software production, you will be rewarded for *accumulated points* 
[three] You can search bugs, share new functions/functionalities
[four] You can donate something, 1$ each day is good enough to help me (coffee is a good diesel)

=== Software dependecies

The software is based upon Ruby on Rails and require a PostgreSQL server.

The testing application is connected to Heroku (https://thinksoftware.herokuapp.com) from master branch.

Any pull request will update the testing platform.


Before Heroku server there is a Travis CI check.

==== Pull instruction

Rules are simple:
* Follow ruby design patterns (and help me to follow them...)
* Cleanest and shortest syntax, code need to be quickly readable
* Describe what have you done in pull request
* Short commit but more stable
* Use software itself (in the testing platform) for each task, so everyone can understand your work
