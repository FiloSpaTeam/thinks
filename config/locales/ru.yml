# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      <p>
      Five are the conditions in which a task is situated:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Backlog</strong>, your task is stored but not in planning</li>
          <li><strong>Release</strong>, your task is planned as next work</li>
          <li><strong>Sprint</strong>, is part of team planning workload - maximum priority</li>
          <li><strong>In progress</strong>, someone is working over</li>
          <li><strong>Done</strong>, task done</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
      When you want automatically switch from <strong>Backlog</strong> to <strong>Release</strong> state, you need to have a number of votes (workload assigned) more than your team minimum number.
      <br>
      Later you can automatically take you task from <strong>Release</strong> to <strong>Sprint</strong> if your team \"<i>Deviation Standard</i>\" is good (it's means your team is aligned and this works is very well designed).
