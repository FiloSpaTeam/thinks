  How does it works?

%h2.chapter-subtitle
  What is that and who can work with?

%p.lead
  This is a web <strong>applications that help teams to handle projects
  and tasks (work)</strong> over time.
  %br
  It is designed with free software, teams, goals and big projects
  in minds.
  %br

%p.lead
  <strong>Everyone can use that and work with</strong> because it's not required
  any special skill.
  %br
  Everyone can contribute in two different ways:
  %ul
    %li.lead
      %i
        Watching:
      suggest something to teams and watch progress
    %li.lead
      %i
        Partecipating:
      suggest, create and work over tasks gaining personal workload

%p.lead
  Moreover, everyone can create a new project (a new idea) and share to others.

%br

%p.lead
  Today a lot of projects are developed by large interconnected teams. But most of them works in different areas and sometimes it's very hard to understand the point of view of others.
  %br
  This is a very limiting thing because most of them cannot understand complexity of the project itself maybe, or undervalue other's work.
  %br
  With this software, each member of team can cooperate and understand easily the progression of:
  %ul
    %li.lead
      entire project
    %li.lead
      specific goal
    %li.lead
      specific release
    %li.lead
      specific task (work)

%hr

%h2.chapter-subtitle
  Understand the engine

%p.lead
  Most of the system is based on Scrum, an agile methodology for teams, but there are functions not provided that will explain in this section with the basic method.

%p.lead
  The most important figure in this software is the user. All works around users. They are the most important and the most exciting part.
  %br
  Without them there are no teams. So you need an account and provide basic informations like email and name.
  %br
  Later you are ready to join to some project or create a new one.

%p.lead
  %i
    %strong
      Important: is an open platform so default projects are open to everyone but team leaders can block access to project itself and report the user! - With great power, comes great responsibility.

%p.lead
  A project describe your idea, so you need to be clear to others to create attentions (good images, good description...), and is composed by:
  %ul
    %li.lead
      Releases
    %li.lead
      Goals
    %li.lead
      Tasks

%h3
  %i
    Releases

%p.lead
  You need to think for
  %strong
    releases
  like the moments in your projects when you want to have salable package. It does not have to be a complete package about your idea. You and your team should decide how many tasks include; can be 20% of the project, or the 50%. It's your choice.
  %br
  You need only to set expected release date.
